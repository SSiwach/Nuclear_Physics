## Harmonic Oscillator Wavefunction (HO_radial):
This function calculates the radial part of a harmonic oscillator wave function. It takes four parameters: r (radial coordinate), n (principal quantum number), l (orbital quantum number), and hw (harmonic oscillator frequency). It computes the wave function using mathematical formulas involving constants like the reduced Planck constant and the neutron and proton masses.

## Reduced Spherical Harmonics (Y_red):
This function computes the reduced spherical harmonics, which are related to the Wigner 3-j symbols. It takes three parameters: l1, l2, and l, which correspond to angular momentum quantum numbers. The function uses these parameters to calculate a specific combination of the Wigner 3-j symbols and returns the result.

## Matrix Element for Y_1 sigma_s Operator (Ysigma):
This function calculates the matrix element for the operator (Y_1 sigma_s)_k, where Y_1 is a spherical harmonic, sigma_s is the spin operator, and k is another quantum number. It takes several parameters: l1 and j1 (angular momentum and total angular momentum for the first particle), l2 and j2 (angular momentum and total angular momentum for the second particle), l (angular momentum for the combined system), s (spin value), and k (quantum number). The function uses various angular momentum coupling coefficients and the reduced spherical harmonics from earlier functions to compute the matrix element.
